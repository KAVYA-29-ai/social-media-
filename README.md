SentimentScope is a Social Media Sentiment Analyzer that generates posts for a given hashtag using Gemini 2.0 Flash, analyzes them using Hugging Face Transformers, and visualizes insights in an interactive dashboard.

Features

Hashtag Post Generation
Generate realistic social media posts using Gemini. Fallback templates ensure continuity if Gemini fails.

Interactive Dashboard

Pie chart for sentiment distribution

Line chart for rolling mood (EMA-like)

Table listing all posts with source (Gemini/Fallback) and sentiment badge

Meta Information

Usage

Enter the number of posts (max 50).

Click Generate & Analyze.

Dashboard displays:

Challenges

Real Social Media APIs are limited or paid; Gemini is used for synthetic post generation.

Handling Gemini failures: fallback templates ensure posts are generated.

Rolling sentiment calculation: EMA smoothing required tuning.

Responsive UI: cosmic background and glassmorphism effects required adjustments for devices.

Limitations

Only English posts supported.

Synthetic posts may not fully reflect real social media trends.

Large hashtags or maximum post count can slow down CPU-only machines.

Uncommon hashtags often rely on fallback templates.

Future Improvements

Integrate real-time social media APIs

Add multi-language support

Implement live streaming of posts

Add filters for sentiment in table view

Improve performance using GPU inference
